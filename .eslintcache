I decide to take that class to learn from a reputed university for free! \n                    \"it's mind-blowing that one can get a world-class education at no cost from the comfort of their home.\" This was an obvious choice for me to learn iOS and Mobile app development. \n                    The joy of making something that others could use and benefit from it is very rewarding.\n                    </p>\n                    <hr />\n\n                    <LearningResources />\n                </div>\n          </div>\n          \n        )\n    }\n}\n\nexport default About","/Users/tanveerbashir/my_protfolio/src/components/navbar.js",[],"/Users/tanveerbashir/my_protfolio/src/components/contact.js",[],"/Users/tanveerbashir/my_protfolio/src/components/learning_resources.js",["43"],"import React, { Component } from 'react'\n\nconst resources = [ \n    {\n        url: 'https://www.freecodecamp.org/',\n        info: ' - Web development and many other important concepts',\n        tag: 'FreeCodeCamp'\n    },\n    {\n        url: 'https://www.raywenderlich.com/',\n        info: ' - great tutorial and plenty of free resource to learn from',\n        tag: 'Ray Wenderlich'\n    },\n    {\n        url: 'https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50M+Mobile/course/',\n        info: '- Mobile app development, React, React-Native',\n        tag: 'HarvardX CS50'\n    },\n    {\n        url: 'https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003',\n        info: ' - iOS Development Nano Degree (paid course)',\n        tag: 'Udacity'\n    },\n    {\n        url: 'https://www.hackingwithswift.com',\n        info: ' - A gold standard if you want to learn best practices of Swift and iOS',\n        tag: 'HackingWithSwift'\n    },\n    {\n        url: 'https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/',\n        info: ' - Swift is a fantastic way to write software',\n        tag: 'Official Swift Guide'\n    }\n]\n\n\nexport class LearningResources extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <p>Resource I used in my journey</p>\n                <ul>\n                {\n                resources.map ( item => <li key={item}><a style={{color: 'blue'}} href={item.url} target=\"_blank\">{item.tag}</a>{item.info}</li> )\n                }\n               </ul>\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n}\n\nexport default LearningResources\n",{"ruleId":"44","replacedBy":"45"},{"ruleId":"46","replacedBy":"47"},{"ruleId":"48","severity":1,"message":"49","line":1,"column":8,"nodeType":"50","messageId":"51","endLine":1,"endColumn":12},{"ruleId":"48","severity":1,"message":"52","line":22,"column":7,"nodeType":"50","messageId":"51","endLine":22,"endColumn":17},{"ruleId":"53","severity":1,"message":"54","line":15,"column":169,"nodeType":"55","endLine":15,"endColumn":199},{"ruleId":"53","severity":1,"message":"54","line":44,"column":56,"nodeType":"55","endLine":44,"endColumn":115},"no-native-reassign",["56"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["57"],"no-unused-vars","'logo' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","'background' is assigned a value but never used.","react/jsx-no-target-blank","Using target=\"_blank\" without rel=\"noreferrer\" is a security risk: see https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#link-type-noopener","JSXOpeningElement","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]
